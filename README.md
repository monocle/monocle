## Hello from Portland!

I'm Henry and am eager to connect with fellow developers and explore opportunities in software development.

### Skills

I have a strong background in web development, with a current focus on JavaScript/TypeScript and Python. I've built projects with React, Ember, Flask and Ruby on Rails. I'm always looking to expand my knowledge and skills.

Recently, I've had a lot of fun on a volunteer-led open source project that is live in production. I built out a new React feature, refactored code and wrote tests in Typescript and Python, troubleshot Docker builds and helped others with code review.

I've also dabbled in other languages like C++, Go, and R, and I'm open to learning new technologies for the right project.

### About Me

I've been programming off an on as a hobby since 2009, and I've built and and deployed several small apps. The largest app was work related and used by over 40 employees.

After spending more than 20 years in healthcare, I'm now pursuing a career change into software development. I'm particularly drawn to community and civic-focused projects, and currently volunteer as a developer for the [RecordSponge](https://recordsponge.com/) project through [Code For PDX](https://www.codeforpdx.org/).

### Let's collobarate!

I'm excited to build my portfolio of projects on Github and to connect with like-minded developers. 

If you have a project in mind and are looking for someone to collaborate with, feel free to reach out at monocle.github@gmail.com.

### Thanks

Thanks to Robin Davidson for their excellent image of Portland!
